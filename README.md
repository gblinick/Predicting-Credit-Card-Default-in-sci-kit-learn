"# Springboard-Capstone-1" 

A project about predicting credit card default in sci-kit learn  based on demographic and financial factors using a variety of machine learning models and comparing the models. 6 models were trained on the data and compared with different metrics. Random Forest was found to be the best model because it had the best precision-recall curve.
